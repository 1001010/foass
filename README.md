Fuck Off As A Service

Back in July 2013, coworkers pointed me to the reddit thread http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1ih750/fuck_off_as_as_service_foaas/ about http://foaas.herokuapp.com/

It was awesomely vulgar, childish and facinating.  Not for the creativity of the comments, but I had never written a web service and I wanted to know how to do it.
So FOASS was born!

FOASS is an experiment in writing a simple stateless web service in python.

Most of the magic is in the .htaccess
The Python script just parses the URI and provides a result - formatted for the mime type of the client.
